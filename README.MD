# ORATOR : THE ONLY WAY TO LISTEN TO PDF'S AND EPUBS

### What is the problem at hand? 
  - there is no app/ tool that converts pdf's for e.g books, to an audible format, extracting all the utilities a pdf reader could such as Outline navigation (if and when an Index or Outline is provided.), bookmarking, continue where you left off etc.
  - Making sure this thing is free and free of virues/ malware.
